Title: A Package for FAIR Forecast
Version: 0.1.0
Description: The main functionality of this package is to implement the FAIR method to any panel data of store-category-level sales time series of a retail. It utilizes orthogonalization, regularization via Elastic net, and extrapolation to account for seasonality, focal- and cross-category marketing activity as well as random disturbances to base sales. It can handle large dimensionality and deal with regularization induced confounding.
